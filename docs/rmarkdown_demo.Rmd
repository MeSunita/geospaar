## Plain text
In this document, we will start to learn the basic syntax to use R markdown to write document. Within a R markdown file, we could have descriptive text, math equations, code chunk, and other settings. R markdown also ignore     multiple spaces, like            this, would     just get one     space. If you really want to add extra space within your text, use non breaking space tag: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;, then you got extra three space.
Want a new line, but fail even though with a carriage return. 

Start a new line with two blank spaces. Within R markdown, trying two blank spaces works like rebooting your machine when something does not work.

## Heading
# level-1
## level-2
### level-3
#### level-4
##### level-...

## Basic format

*italics* and **bold** or _italics_ and __bold__.

~~strikethrough~~

superscript^2^

subscript~3~

There is no defined underline syntax in R markdown. But R markdown also takes HTML tags, so we could use <ins>underline</ins> for underline.

We also could use them together, e.g. **<ins>underline and bold</ins>**, ***italics and bold***, ***<ins>underline and bold and italics</ins>***

## List

Have an unordered list first:

* unordered list
* another one
    * sub-item (indented)
    * sub-item
      + sub-sub-item
      + sub-sub-item
- item-3
* item-4

Have an ordered list then:

1. ordered list
2. another item
    + sub-unordered item
    + sub-unordered item
      1. sub-sub-ordered item
      2. sub-sub-ordered item
3. item-3
1. item-4 (even though I type 1, it still show 4 in the text)
      
Sometimes, two blank spaces are necessary between two items when using some template.

## Insert
### Code
R code chunk:
```{r chunk_exp, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
x <- 2
print(x)
```

It is better to name your code chunk. Two chunks cannot have the same name. And specify chunk options based on your need.

Inline code with evaluation `r 4 * 3` .

Inline code just for display `sum`.

### Image
Insert an image using ![](figures/r.png)

or we could use code chunk to insert:

```{r, out.width = "20%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r.png")
```

### Link
We could insert a link using [link](https://www.r-project.org).

### Math equation
Inline equation: $A = \pi*r^{2}$

Equation chunk: $$A = \pi*r^{2}$$

## Blockquote

### One block

> blockquote here

### Block with multiple paragraphs

> blockquote paragraph1
>
> blockquote paragraph2

### Nested block

> blockquote
>
>> Nested blockquote

### A formatted block

> ### inside of blockquote, other also works
>
> - quote 1
> - quote 2
>
>> Nested **blockquote**
