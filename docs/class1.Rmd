## Introductions 

- COVID preparedness (revised)
- Zoom considerations
-

## Class Overview

- By the end of this class, you should:
    - Be comfortable in working with R, including most common geospatial functions
    - Have a good sense of where R is headed as a language
    - Know where to look when don't know how to do something
    - Be using R as part of a ___reproducible___ workflow

- Course approach
    - (Largely) flipped model and emphasis on problem solving
        - Programming should be fun! (or at least intriguing)
    - Lab and office hours as help sessions

---

## Reproducibility 1

```{r, out.width = "70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/class1_1.png")
```

---

## Reproducibility 2
```{r, out.width = "50%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/class1_2.png")
```
