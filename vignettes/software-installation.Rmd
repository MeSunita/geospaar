# Overview
If you have previously installed any of the software below, we recommend you  upgrade to the most current stable version.

# Installation
## Step 1: Install Git
Go to [Installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and follow the instruction to install Git for your operating system (Linux x86, Mac, Windows, etc).

## Step 2: Install R
Go to [R page](https://www.r-project.org) and download the current stable release, R 4.2.1, using the correct version for your operating system (Linux x86, Mac, Windows, etc).

## Step 3: Install RStudio Desktop
Go to [RStudio page](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and download the current stable release, using the correct version for your operating system (Linux x86, Mac, Windows, etc).

## Step 4: Install RTools (Windows only)
Windows machine needs RTools to build some packages from source. It is better to install it beforehand. Go to [RTools page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to read the instruction, then download and install.

## Step 5: (Optionally) install GDAL
GDAL is a widely used library for geospatial data. A lot of R geospatial packages rely on it. R packages at the point (I think) typically don't require it to function properly, but it will likely be useful for research projects later in the class. The way to install it differs by operating systems:

- Windows: go to this [page](https://gdal.org/download.html) to download and install the current stable version.

- Mac: a bit trickier, but probably best is to install using `homebrew` (see [here](https://brew.sh/) for how to install it): `brew install gdal`.

- Linux: If you use a Linux machine, try to search the tutorial online for your operating systems to install. For example, GDAL is available for Ubuntu from the [UbuntuGIS-Stable PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis/+archive/ubuntu/ppa?field.series_filter=xenial). Let's solve together if you got any issues.
